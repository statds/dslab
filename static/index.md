# Connecticut Data Science Lab

## Real World Data Science Problems Meet<br>Future Data Scientists

Connecticut Data Science Lab is organized as a standing interest/study
group in the form of a student organization, with a faculty advisory
board providing training in data manipulation, programming, statistical
modeling, variable engineering, model selection/validation, and
communication about the results. Specific functions are as follows.

-   Provide a credited course about Statistics in Data Science, where
    students learn through collaboratively solving real-world data
    science problems under the guidance of faculty instructors.
-   Maintain an open-source database of case studies in Data Science,
    and corresponding "toolbox" available for download.
-   Maintain a department-wide (possibly campus-wide in the future) data
    science support through a standing committee.
