Wenjie became a Research Scientist at Eli Lilly and Company after
graduation. He had strong interest in the development of open source
software for statistical methods and models mostly in R and Python.
Consequently, he has been developing and maintaining a few R packages,
such as splines2, dynsurv, and reda. He believes that it is an
exciting and challenging world for statisticians and/or data
scientists. He was closely involved in the initiation stage of our
lab. He gave multiple workshops on R and developed the R Markdown
template for project reports.
