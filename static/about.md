# Connecticut Data Science Lab

## Real World Data Science Problems Meet<br>Future Data Scientists


Connecticut Data Science Lab is organized as a standing
interest/study group in the form of a student organization, with a
faculty advisory board providing training in data manipulation,
programming, statistical modeling, variable engineering, model
selection/validation, and communication about the results.
Specific functions are as follows. 

+ Provide a credited course about Statistics in Data Science, where
  students learn through collaboratively solving real-world data
  science problems under the guidance of faculty instructors.
+ Maintain an open-source database of case studies in Data Science,
  and corresponding "toolbox" available for download. 
+ Maintain a department-wide (possibly campus-wide in the future) data
  science support through a standing committee.
